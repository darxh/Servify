## 📖 About The Project

**Servify** is a professional-grade marketplace architecture designed to solve the fragmentation in local service bookings. It features a dual-interface system (Customer & Provider) with real-time status updates, robust security, and a seamless booking engine.

Built to demonstrate scalable backend logic and a responsive modern frontend.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
* **JWT & Cookie Management:** Secure HttpOnly cookie implementation for session management.
* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Strictly typed roles for `Admin`, `Provider`, and `Customer`.
* **Data Protection:** Bcrypt hashing for passwords and sanitized API inputs.

### 🏪 Marketplace Engine
* **Dynamic Listings:** Providers have full CRUD capabilities for their service portfolios.
* **Smart Categorization:** Admin-managed taxonomy (e.g., Plumbing, Cleaning, Electrical).
* **Booking Workflow:** State-machine logic for bookings (`Pending` → `Confirmed` → `Completed`).
* **Conflict Prevention:** Self-booking restrictions and duplicate review prevention.

### ⭐ Trust System
* **Verified Reviews:** Only customers with completed bookings can leave reviews.
* **Rating Aggregation:** Real-time calculation of provider ratings.
